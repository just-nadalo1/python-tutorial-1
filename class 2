syntax of fuctions( in other word the way u are supposed to write functions)
function_name(arguments)

arguments can either be strings, integers and floats

A literal is data whose values are determined by the literal itself.

the exponentiation operator uses right-sided binding.

Priority	Operator	
1	**	
2	+, - (note: unary operators located next to the right of the power operator bind more strongly)	unary
3	*, /, //, %	
4	+, -	binary

 A unary operator is an operator with only one operand, e.g., -1, or +3.

 A binary operator is an operator with two operands, e.g., 4 + 5, or 12 % 5
 Some operators act before others â€“ the hierarchy of priorities:

the ** operator (exponentiation) has the highest priority;
then the unary + and - (note: a unary operator to the right of the exponentiation operator binds more strongly, for example: 4 ** -1 equals 0.25)
then *, /, //, and %;
and, finally, the lowest priority: the binary + and -.
7. Subexpressions in parentheses are always calculated first, e.g., 15 - 1 * (5 * (1 + 2)) = 0.

8. The exponentiation operator uses right-sided binding, e.g., 2 ** 2 ** 3 = 256.

practice codes
print("My name is", "Python.", end=" ")
print("Monty Python.")
print("My", "name", "is", "Monty", "Python.", sep="&")



what is d difference between end and sep
