variables

If you want to give a name to a variable, you must follow some strict rules:

the name of the variable must be composed of upper-case or lower-case letters, digits, and the character _ (underscore)
the name of the variable must begin with a letter;
the underscore character is a letter;
upper- and lower-case letters are treated as different (a little differently than in the real world - Alice and ALICE are the same first names, but in Python they are two different variable names, and consequently, two different variables);
the name of the variable must not be any of Python's reserved words (the keywords - we'll explain more about this soon).

assigning a variable to itself
var = 1
print(var)
var = var + 1
print(var)
